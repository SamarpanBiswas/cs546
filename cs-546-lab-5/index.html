        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Khayyam Saleem. I was born in Saudi Arabia, but since then I have lived in 4
          other different countries (United Arab Emirates, Pakistan, Japan, United States). I grew
          up without much traditional wealth, but lots of love from my family and enough resources 
          to grow up well-fed, well-mannered, and well-trained. I played soccer in a past life, but 
          have since foregone such frivolties in favor of pursuing excellence in the field of computer 
          science. I currently attend Stevens Institute of Technology, where I am enrolled in the 
          undergraduate Computer Science program and the graduate Applied Mathematics program. I hope 
          to one day combine these skills to solve complex computational problems.
