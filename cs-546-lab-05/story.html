    <h1>The Time I Biked From Hoboken to Montclair</h1>
    <main>
        <p>
            Once upon a time, a childhood friend invited me to go see a Fetty Wap concert.
            Now, though I harbor little respect for an artist like Fetty Wap, I seldom got 
            the chance to hang out with this childhood friend, and it provided me an 
            opportunity to get out of Hoboken for a while and mix up my otherwise stale 
            lifestyle. Thus, I agreed. But the concert was in Montclair, and I was in Hoboken.
            I checked public transportation first, but it involved three separate transfers, 
            and I would have to take a bus instead of a train, and I abhor buses. I checked 
            rideshare apps like Lyft and Uber, but both yielded prices that my wallet was 
            not worthy of. Hence, I decided to hop on my trusty 
            <a href="https://brompton.com">Brompton</a> and bike all the way there. I was 
            relatively new to biking at the time, but I was excited to put my new expensive 
            bicycle to a true test of endurance and I couldn't think of a better way to get to
            Montclair. So I set off!
        </p>
        <p>
            I trusted Google Maps would take me on a scenic, idyllic route, from whence I could 
            listen to the birds chirp and feel the pebbles bounce off my tires as I rode along.
            However, this was not the case. Google Maps leaves lots of critical information out 
            for bikers; information like:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>There will be highways.</li>
                <li>It will get VERY dark before you arrive.</li>
                <li>It is unwise to bike this route after having taken acid.</li>
                <li>Your bike should be able to ascend steep inclines.</li>
                <li>Your phone will die.</li>
                <li>Your legs will give out before the 16 miles are up.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            Nevertheless, I powered through the pain and the discomfort and the tripping, and 
            arrived in Montclair in one piece! As I arrived at my friend's home, he shined a 
            flashlight in my face and recorded my arrival for his Snapchat followers. He showered 
            both surprise and ridicule and respect at my cyclical adventure.
        </p>

            Little did I know, my journey was not over just then. As soon as I began
            to get settled down on my friend's couch to rest my weary legs after my journey, 
            he tugged me back up to my feet and said that it was time to leave for the concert. 
            His friend arrived at the door in a car to pick us up, and we thought that we were 
            on our way to the concert to have a good time. However, his friend had other plans.
            He refused to attend the concert without imbibing and having a rendezvous with his 
            close friend, Mary Jane. After we finally picked up the materials required to do so, 
            we had already burned two more hours and were officially three hours late for the 
            concert. Thankfully, being the degenerate that he is, Fetty Wap had STILL not come 
            on, and his openers were growing weak in their efforts to keep the crowd entertained 
            while Fetty Wap decided whether or not he wanted to come on stage. Thankfully, after 
            what felt like days, he made his presence on stage and the crowd went WILD. He 
            performed his hit singles, "Again", "Trap Queen", "679", and "My Way", as well as 
            presenting his own renditions of popular songs like Cardi B's "Bodak Yellow."
        </p>
        <p>
            At the close of the concert, us three fatigued souls retired to my friend's home to 
            have another brief conversation with Mary Jane. After the discussion, it was near to 
            3AM and we were all tired and sweaty and confused, so we went to sleep. The next 
            morning, at 10AM sharp, I woke up and volunteered at a homeless shelter with the 
            friend, before hopping back on my trusty Brompton and making my way home. After that
            day, I vowed to never trust Google Maps for bike routes again.
